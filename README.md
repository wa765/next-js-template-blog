# NextJS Blog Template

**Note : I not build this from scratch, I just combined from [James Wallis](https://github.com/james-wallis/wallis.dev) and [Timothy](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/)**

This is a Next.js, Tailwind CSS blogging starter template. Comes out of the box configured with the latest technologies to make technical writing a breeze. Easily configurable and customizable. Perfect as a replacement to existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs.
